* xmind-org.el
This is a small Emacs package for importing [[https://www.xmind.net/][XMind]] mindmap files to Org mode.
It was created to produce a skill list from [[https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin/frontend-mindmaps][Frontend / React Developer Mindmaps]], and only minimal presentation features are supported for now.
